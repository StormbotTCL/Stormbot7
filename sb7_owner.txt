How will the bot learn you as its new (permanent) owner?

TELNET:
	(1) TELNET the bot
	(2) enter "NEW"
	(3) enter your password
	(4) get on the same channel as your bot (however you want to do this)
	(5) find your host via ".channel" command
	(6) .+HOST <handle> <*!*@* formatted mask>
	(7) Jump to step #8 below

IRC:
	(1) join a channel with your bot (any channel will do)
	(2) /msg bot HELLO
	(3) set your password
	(4) LOGIN with the password you just set
	(5) use the WHOAMI command [this will set your 1000 / 1001 level]
	(6) set your OPASS: /msg bot opass <owner password>
	(7) jump to step #8 below

Continuing:
	(8) DCC CHAT or TELNET your bot (if you TELNETted before, just leave it open / stay there)
	(9) .channel <#channel you share with your bot>
	(10) You should see a line:
		@Domino          Domino        ---  N  1m  Domino@Coder.StormBot.Org
	(11) The line should consist of: your current nick, your "handle" , a useless value, the letter N, your on-channel idle time, and finally your current mask (without NICK! on it)
