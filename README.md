Stormbot7
=========

This is the next version of Stormbot. This release is another complete rewrite of the original code when it was first written in 1997 by authors David P. Hansen, Dave Klein, and Justin Hammond.

David wrote the original Stormbot code at the University of Aarhus in Denmark and created the original Stormbot IRC channel, #storm_chasers. Later, Dave Klein came aboard the project and they moved to the #Bothouse IRC channel which also gave birth to a host of immitators that still exist to this day.

Since that time, StormBot has moved to its own IRC network (irc://chat.bothouse.net). Many people have contributed to StormBot.TCL over the years. Contributions include donation of time in debugging the script, donating bots to test new functions, donating servers when forming the test-bed network, and the ALPHA and BETA testers of the most-recent incartion (Presently version 6.0). Also included are those whom have donated web servers, wrote helper scripts, and/or donated command bead code (or code suggestions).

Thanks to those who were contributors or bug reporters for SB3, SB4, SB5. Everything I (Mai Mizuno) have learned has gone into making StormBot a better product.

Reverse-credit acknowledgement: #NordicBots on QuakeNet, especially admin TheAvatar, because they acknowledged me for the assistance I (Mai Mizuno) gave them with their earlier work. Eventually, their coders created the Natasha bot (http://www.nordicbots.com/?id=143). That was very nice of them.

An acknowledgement from Eggdrop core for a major recursive bug we found by the way of the "UPDATE" command in SB6 -- from Eggdrop 1.6.21 release notes (http://cvs.eggheads.org/viewvc/eggdrop1.6/doc/Changes1.6?view=markup):
> \#100 - do_restart is now reset before actually performing a rehash or restart to

> \#101 ensure it doesn't do it again infinitely.

> \#102 Found by: Domino / Patch by: thommey

Rødgrød med fløde!
